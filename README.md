# Numerical Integration
Python implementation of basic numerical integration methods. Almost based on Essential Algorithms by Rod Stevens, Wikipedia, some philosophy of SICP and a little of OOP.

By now rectangle rule, trapezoid rule, Simpson's method, adaptive quadrature and Monte-Carlo method are supported. Fast parallel computations with JIT compilation are provided by numba.
